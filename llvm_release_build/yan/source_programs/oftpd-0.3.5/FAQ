Q: When I try to upload I get an error.  What am I doing wrong?

A: Nothing.  oftpd does not allow you to upload files, create
   directories, use any other FTP comands that modify the filesystem of
   the server.  This is the way it is supposed to work.  If the code
   doesn't write files, there's no way it can write them incorrectly!


Q: Okay, can you add the STOR command, so I can upload files?  I
   promise, I'll only use it on a secure network.

A: This is possible, and I may add this some day.  (Or, if you have some
   C programming background, you can add it yourself - the code's not
   that bad, I promise.)  I don't have any dates in mind, however.  ;)


Q: Is there a Debian/Red Hat/whatever package for oftpd?

A: Matthew Danish has a preliminary Debian package available at:

    ftp://emu.res.cmu.edu/pub/new-packages/

   There are not any RPM's that I know of.  The install should be fairly
   painless, but I'll probably put together an RPM at some point.


Q: It doesn't compile on my system.  What am I doing wrong?

A: Probably nothing.  All known compiler issues have been resolved, but
   there may still be problems.  Send me an e-mail and I'll try to help
   you through any problems.
