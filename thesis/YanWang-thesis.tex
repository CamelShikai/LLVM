%
% Change History:
%
% 1.3.0	**	Added the cite package.
%
%		**	Give that the Graduate School now allows essentially
%			any line spacing, I have moved the line space setting
%			from psuthesis.cls to this driver file. Go ahead and
%			make it ugly if you want. :-)
%
%		**	Removed \addtocounter{page}{-1} after \psutitlepage is
%			executed. It made the paging of the frontmatter
%			incorrect. I can no longer remember why it was there.
%
%		**	Removed \psusigpage since the Graduate School now
%			provides the signature page.
%
%		**	Added the command \collegesubmittedto to add the College
%			in which the thesis/dissertation has been completed to
%			the title page.
%
%		**	Added instructions for documents that include a single
%			appendix since the Graduate School just hates calling it
%			``Appendix A'' is there is a single appendix.
%
%		**	Removed the fncychap package since I could not easily
%			find a way to make it work with documents that have a
%			single appendix.
%
%		**	Added the titlesec package so that the user can make the
%			format of the chapter titles a little less boring than
%			LaTeX's default.
%
% 1.2.2	**	Added some information to the main driver file (this
%			file) regarding the use of hyperref with the
%			psuthesis class. Thanks to Nathan Urban for pointing
%			out the included workaround.
%
% 1.2.1	**	Finally reproduced and fixed the problem where the
%			page number listed in the TOC for the Bibliography
%			was the last page number of the Bibliography.
%
%		**	Added 10pt and 11pt options to the document class,
%			though we have no idea why anyone would want to use
%			such insanely small font sizes since it will lead to
%			line lengths that are much too long.
%
% 1.2.0	**	Two additional class options have been added to
%			support honors theses submitted to the Schreyer
%			Honors College. These options are:
%			- honors
%			- honorsdepthead
%			See below for details.
%
%		**	We have also added the commands:
%			- honorsdegreeinfo
%			- honorsadviser
%			- honorsdepthead
%			Again, see below for details.
%
% 1.1.2	**	If you want to use the subfigure package with our
%			psuthesis class file, then you must must find the 
%			following line in the psuthesis.cls file:
%
%			\RequirePackage{tocloft}
%
%			and add the subfigure option. We have already set
%			this up for you in the psuthesis.cls file to make
%			this easy to do.
%
% 1.1.1	**	Added the fncychap package to the distribution.
%
% 1.1.0	**	The way that the thesis frontmatter and backmatter
%			is generated has been completely re-done in order
%			to be more intuitive.
%
%		**	We have added the ability to change the title of
%			the Dedication/Epigraph to anything you please.
%
%		**	In the process of changing the format of the Table
%			of Contents to conform to the inflexible rules of
%			the Grad School (the word ``Chapter'' and
%			``Appendix'' need to appear before the number and
%			letter, respectively), we have added an option to
%			the class called inlinechaptertoc that changes the
%			format of the Chapter/Appendix entries in the TOC.
%			Note that the tocloft package is now required.
%
%		**	Appendices should now start with the
%			\Appendix command rather than \chapter. See the
%			accompanying files for examples.
%
%		**	Added information regarding the Nontechnical
%			Abstract that is required of ESM students.
%
%		**	Added the fncychap package for those of you who like
%			the nice Chapter headings it provides. We like
%			Lenny, but you don't have to use it if you don't
%			want to. In addition, the other options are: Sonny,
%			Glenn, Conny, Rejne, and Bjarne
%
% 1.0.4	**	fixed the \addcontentsline entry for BibTeX within
%			the commented out text in the Bibliography section
%
% 1.0.3	**	added a sigpage option to conform to new Grad School
%			requirements
%
% 1.0.2	**	issued the \appendix command to start the appendices
%
%		**	moved the \addcontentsline for the bibliography so
%			that the bibliography now shows up on the right page
%			in the TOC
%
%		**	added some info if you use bibtex
%
% 1.0.1	**	eqlist and eqparbox are now included in the archive
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This is a template file to help get you started using the
% psuthesis.cls for theses and dissertations at Penn State
% University. You will, of course, need to put the
% psuthesis.cls file someplace that LaTeX will find it.
%
% We have set up a directory structure that we find to be clean
% and convenient. You can readjust it to suit your tastes. In
% fact, the structure used by our students is even a little
% more involved and commands are defined to point to the
% various directories.
%
% This document has been set up to be typeset using pdflatex.
% About the only thing you will need to change if typesetting
% using latex is the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command.
%
% The psuthesis document class uses the same options as the
% book class. In addition, it requires that you have the
% ifthen, calc, setspace, and tocloft packages.
%
% The first additional option specifies the degree type. You
% can choose from:
%	Ph.D. using class option <phd>
%	M.S. using class option <ms>
%	M.Eng. using class option <meng>
%	M.A. using class option <ma>
%	B.S. using class option <bs>
%	B.A. using class option <ba>
%	Honors Baccalaureate using the option <honors>
%
% If you specify either ba or bs in addition to honors, it will
% just use the honors option and ignore the ba or bs option.
%
% The second additional option <inlinechaptertoc> determines
% the formatting of the Chapter entries in the Table of
% Contents. The default sets them as two-line entries (try it).
% If you want them as one-line entries, issue the
% inlinechaptertoc option.
%
% The class option ``honors'' should be used for theses
% submitted to the Schreyer Honors College. This option
% changes the formatting on the Title page so that the
% signatures appear on the Title page.
%
% The class option ``honorsdepthead'' adds the signature of the
% department head on the Title page for those baccalaureate
% theses that require this.
%
% The class option ``secondthesissupervisor'' should be used
% for baccalaureate honors degrees if you have a second
% Thesis Supervisor.
%
% The vita is only included with the phd option and it is
% placed at the end of the thesis. The permissions page is only
% included with the ms, meng, and ma options.
