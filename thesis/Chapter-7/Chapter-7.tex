\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we propose a novel obfuscation technique using 
 Turing machines. We have implemented a research prototype, Turing
machine obfuscator, on the LLVM platform and evaluated %Turing machine obfuscator
on open source software with respect to functionality
correctness, potency, resilience, stealth, and cost. The results
indicate effectiveness and robustness of Turing machine obfuscation. We believe
Turing machine obfuscation could be a promising and practical obfuscation tool to
battle malicious reverse engineering.
