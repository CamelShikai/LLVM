Internet provides people all kinds of information and opportunities, however, it also provides chances for hackers to spread their malwares to end users all over the world.

Software obfuscation is a crucial research field due to the
severe computer security situation of Internet era. Usually we try to make programs more explicit and clearer for people to read while software obfuscation focuses on 
complicating source programs to make it difficult or even impossible for attackers to do reverse engineering so that malicious codes and
software vulnerabilities are constrained from spreading. 

In this paper we proposed a novel method to do software obfuscation. In source codes, control flow graph was changed with the help of Turing machine encoding.
Predicates which are determinative for the control flow traversing in source codes are transformed to different Turing machines. These encoded Turing machines will be interpreted by an universal Turing machine when executed. Hence, control flow graph could be complicated to a great extent
by leveraging this transformation. Software is obfuscated
through this Turing machine encoding and connecting segmented source programs with Turing Machine models. This paper articulate our Turing machine obfuscation in detail and demonstrate the effectiveness through large volume of experiments.
